- See changes in content when hovered

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Live Site](https://zitescody.github.io/nft-preview/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
I learned how to implement a grid system to keep content center. I never did this before (always used flex).


### Continued development
Background colors on an image overlay is giving me a headache. I want to continue optimizing my content to be dynamic (hover, active, focus states).
